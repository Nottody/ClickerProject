# Idle Game to Test True Spending Awareness in Abstacted Versus Non-Abstracted Microtransactions

In this project, we created a simple idle game in which aims to test if players are able to keep track of their True Spending Value better in the case of currency being abstracted versus a lack of abstraction.

## Background

- Abstracted Currency: Abstracted Currency, sometimes referred to in games as Premium Currency, is currency that is paid for with real-life currency, such as Gems in *Clash of Clans* or Crowns in *Wizard 101*. Sometimes these games will give you small quantities of this currency for free, but that is irrelevant to our study.

- Idle games: Idle games are a form of game in which progress can be made when the player is doing nothing at all. The most common form of this is where the player has to raise a main in-game currency by clicking a button. The rate of in-game currency increase can be raised by using the currency to increase the value of currency per button click, or the rate of passive income earned. A popular example of this form of game is *Cookie Clicker*.

- True Spending Value: The actual value of the real-world currency spent on microtransactions.
