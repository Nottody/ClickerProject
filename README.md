In this project, we created a simple idle game in which aims to test if players are able to keep track of their True Spending Value better in the case of currency being abstracted versus a lack of abstraction.

## Background

- Microtransactions: "Microtransactions" is the term used for small purchases, usually to buy virtual goods within a game.

- Abstracted Currency: Abstracted Currency, sometimes referred to in games as Premium Currency, is currency that is paid for with real-life currency, such as Gems in *Clash of Clans* or Crowns in *Wizard 101*. Sometimes these games will give you small quantities of this currency for free, but that is irrelevant to our study.

- Idle games: Idle games are a form of game in which progress can be made when the player is doing nothing at all. The most common form of this is where the player has to raise a main in-game currency by clicking a button. The rate of in-game currency increase can be raised by using the currency to increase the value of currency per button click, or the rate of passive income earned. A popular example of this form of game is *Cookie Clicker*.

- True Spending Value: The actual value of the real-world currency spent on microtransactions.

## Study Format

For this study, we have created an idle game in order to ascertain how well users are able to accurately keep track of how much money they have spent on microtransactions. This was accomplished through the following steps:

- The game is distributed to participants. They have either recieved a version of the game in which microtransaction purchases are either abstracted or non-abstracted.

- Participants have then been asked to fill out a preliminary survey asking various questions of them, such as their experience in playing games, if they have played an idle game before, etc.

- After the preliminary survey, they were then allowed to start the game. In the game, the objective is simple. The player has to raise the amount of "bits," which is the name of the in-game currency, to 1,000,000.

- Throughout the process of the game, participants recieved a fictional in-game "paycheck" that could either be spent on microtransactions for the game, or on the virtual pet inside the game. Purchases for the virtual pet are meant to simulate the need to spend money on things other than microtransactions, so these purchases were not included in the true spending value.

- After the game was over (when the participants reached one million bits), participants were met with a closing survey with a few more questions, but most importantly the question "What do you think is the true value of what you have spent?"

- The responses to both the preliminary and final surveys were then sent to a third person platform to be aggragated and organized

- The study's findings were then collected and organized into our final presentation and paper regarding the study.
